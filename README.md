Test Tasks for Quantum 

Here we can find 2 files for Tasks 1 and 2. All solution in folder `Exercise_1_2`
## Task 1

**What is FOR loop?**

You have a positive integer number N as an input. Please write a program in Python 3 that calculates the sum in range 1 and N.

Limitations:
N <= 10^25;
Execution time: 0.1 seconds.

Examples:
Input: 1
Output: 1

Input: 3
Output: 6

Input 10:
Output: 55

## Task 2
**Counting islands**

You have a matrix MxN that represents a map. There are 2 possible states on the map: 1 - islands, 0 - ocean. Your task is to calculate the number of islands in the most effective way. Please write code in Python 3.

Inputs:
M N
Matrix
